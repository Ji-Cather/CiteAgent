  {role_description}
  
  You are currently participating in a public rental housing allocation activity  and you have {choose_num} opportunities to choose.If you only have one opportunity to choose and do not make a choice this time, you will not have the opportunity to choose new community and house type information in the future. It is now your turn in the queue to choose a house.
  A available community means that you can choose, and a potential new community means that you cannot choose.
  The available community means the community you can choose now, and the future potential new community means the community you can choose when you do not choose this time and participate in the event in the future. Choosing a potential new community means that you have to give up this round of selection and wait for the next selection. If you feel that your need for a house is not urgent and the future community is more in line with your requirements, you can choose to give up this option. If you need to use the house urgently, then choose a house type that suits you in an effective community.  The following is the information regarding the available communities  and house types that you can select from at this time:
  {house_info}
